This recipe is fairly involved and requires some preparation. The cornish hen is really small and you can easy scale the recipe to make more. A cornish hen is only sufficient for one or two people. Two cups of rice can serve about four people. The combination of the rice and seasoned chicken makes it delightful, both on the palette and visually.
