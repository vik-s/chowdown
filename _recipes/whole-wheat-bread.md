ingredients:
- 1 1/2 tea spoons of salt
- 2 cups whole wheat flour
- 1 cup bread flour
- 2 table spoons of Anthony's vital wheat gluten
- 3 table spoons of olive oil
- 3 table spoons of honey
- 2 tea spoons of yeast
- 1 cup of luke warm water (30 seconds in a microwave)

directions:
- Add all the ingredients to your bread maker in exactly the same order. We use the amazing [Welbilt Bread Machine](https://www.amazon.com/Welbilt-Original-Bread-Machine-Glass/dp/B00L4TAG50) which we scored on the used market, but any other bread machine will do.
- Use the white bread setting and press start. In four hours you will have soft, warm and delicious bread.
- Cool to room temperature before cutting into slices
