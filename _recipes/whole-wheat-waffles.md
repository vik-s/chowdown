An easy recipe that is a much healthier option that store bought waffles.
The whole wheat flour gives a different color to the waffle that you might be used to.
You can always use all purpose flour instead, if you don't prefer the whole wheat taste or texture.
Using vegetable oil instead of butter in the batter results in a fluffier waffle.
